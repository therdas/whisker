# Whisker
## What is this about?
This was inspired by 2010's-era online desktops. As far as I remember, I was using debian with XFCE at that time (Pentium IV anyone?), and did not like how the whisker-menu looked. This was an attempt to "design" a better whisker-menu. The design's aged well.

## Scope
- [x] A taskbar
- [] Some very simple apps to check how it'd behave
- [] More?

## Archived
This is a very old, almost throwaway project I had laying around - as such, it's been archived. I won't be extending this.
